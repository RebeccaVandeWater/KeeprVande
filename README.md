# Welcome to Keepr!

This website is a Pinterest clone that allows users to create and interact with keeps and vaults. Users may create, edit, and delete their own keeps and vaults. 
They can also make their vaults private, meaning that no other user will be able to see it on the original user's profile page, or force navigate to that vault. 
Users may also save other user's keeps to their own vaults, creating a many-to-many relationship between the two tables.

Keepr was the final project at CodeWorks, a software bootcamp. It was the culmination of everything that I learned from CodeWorks over the 13 weeks of my attendance, and showed my progression from very little experience in software engineering to being able to build a complex application!
